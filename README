This respository contains code framework of my master thesis in the group of Prof. Felix Deschler at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Heidelberg. 
It contains classes for experimental data analysis of the CPL Setup proposed in "Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy" (Kitzmann et al. 2023) as well as theoretical digital twin software using
the Stokes-MÃ¼ller matrix approach for artefact analysis.
